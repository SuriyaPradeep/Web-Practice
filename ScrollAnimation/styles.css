/* .box: This class styles a div element with the following properties:
background-color: #9b7eb6;: Sets a light purple background color for the box.
color: #fff;: Sets the text color inside the box to white.
display: flex;: Makes the box a flex container.

border-radius: 10px;: Rounds the corners of the box with a 10-pixel radius.
transform: translateX(400%);: Moves the box 400% to the right of its original position on the x-axis, making it initially off-screen.
transition: transform 0.4s ease;: Adds a smooth transition effect to the transform property, animating changes over 0.4 seconds with an easing function. */

/* Selector: .box:nth-of-type(even)
This CSS rule targets elements with the class box that are in even positions among their siblings of the same type.
:nth-of-type(even) selects every second element, starting from the second one. In a sequence of .box elements, it would select the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.

Property: transform: translateX(-400%);
The transform property is used to apply a transformation to the element.
translateX(-400%) specifically moves the element horizontally along the x-axis.
-400% moves the element to the left by 400% of its own width, which usually places it far off to the left side of its original position, typically out of the visible area. */

.box:nth-of-type(even) {
  transform: translateX(-400%);
}

/* Selector: .box.show
This CSS rule targets elements that have both the box class and the show class.
It applies only to elements that meet both criteria (e.g., <div class="box show">).

Property: transform: translateX(0);
Again, the transform property is used to apply a transformation to the element.
translateX(0) moves the element horizontally to the position 0 on the x-axis, effectively resetting any horizontal translation applied to it.
This means the element will be moved back to its original position. */

.box.show {
  transform: translateX(0);
}

/* Positioning:
position: absolute;: Positions the .info elements absolutely within their closest positioned ancestor. This means they are positioned relative to the first parent element with a position other than static.
top: 87%;: Positions the top edge of the .info elements 87% down from the top edge of their containing block (in this case, their closest positioned ancestor).
width: 100%;: Sets the width of the .info elements to 100% of their containing block's width.

Alignment
align-items: center;: Aligns the contents of the .info elements along the cross-axis (vertically) to the center.
justify-content: center;: Aligns the contents of the .info elements along the main-axis (horizontally) to the center.
These properties combined center the content both horizontally and vertically within the .info elements.

Appearance:
border-radius: 10px;: Rounds the corners of the .info elements with a border radius of 10 pixels.
background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);: Sets the background color of the .info elements to a semi-transparent black color. The rgba function allows specifying an alpha value (opacity), with 0.5 making it 50% transparent.
color: rgb(244, 236, 236);: Sets the text color inside the .info elements to a light gray.
text-align: center;: Aligns the text content of the .info elements to the center horizontally. */
